The Bylaws Committee will issue a recommendation, including compliance with laws and the CWA Constitution, for the Executive Board who will determine if the proposed amendment shall be voted upon by the Membership. The proposed amendment will then be introduced at the next regularly scheduled membership meeting or will be advertised via normal communication channels (i.e. local newsletter, bulletin boards, email, direct mail) at least (15) days in advance. This will be followed by a majority vote of members in good standing of the Local. The vote shall be held on the same day as the subsequent regularly scheduled membership meeting or by referendum.

\article{Adoption}
These bylaws shall be adopted upon the approval of a majority of the members voting upon their adoption in the membership meeting called for that purpose or by referendum of the membership.
